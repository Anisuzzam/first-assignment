                    COVID-19 safety precautions and restrictions differ from school to school.
                    Children under the age of five may be subject to different guidelines than those who are COVID-19 vaccine eligible.
                   If the COVID-19 situation changes — for example, if the number of new cases in your area begins to climb — keep a watch out for policy changes at your child's school.
                  The number of COVID-19 instances related with school connections in the local community often follows a similar trend.
                Make the best option for you and your family based on open discussions with your child's doctor and school, as well as credible COVID-19 information sources like the CDC's school-based recommendations.
